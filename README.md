## Project Description

The main objective of this project was to train and consolidate the skills acquired throughout the course. Get data from different sources, safely store it in a database and generate an analysis with relevant visualization.
In this project, we thought of a topic, find the data, complete an end-to-end analysis, and present the data in a variety of ways. My chosen topic of interest was my readings, focusing on the readings of 2022.
Data were collected via WebScraping from the virtual bookshelf website (Skoob) and supplemented with information provided by ChatGPT (year of first publication and country of origin of the book/author).

## ðŸ›  Tools

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Tableau, Sklearn (Linear and Logistic Regression)

## ðŸ›  Data Source:

https://www.skoob.com.br/perfil/Renata.Aimi

##  ðŸ’» Aggregation and Scrapping:

The information was collected via Webcraping, all the aggregation and analysis were made with pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn and Tableau.

##  ðŸ’» Analysis:

My goal was to identify my reading patterns to guide my future reading choices. Focusing on diversity in relation to the countries of origin of the book/author and the proportion of representation between male and female authors.
Also, create a model that would predict my rating of the book (like/dislike) based on the average ratings of other readers.

The dashboards were developed in Tableau:

##  ðŸ’» Conclusion:

The logistic regression model can predict with some significance whether or not I will like the book based on the average rating of the book and the genre (fiction / non-fiction).
Data visualizations showed that there is a greater consumption of English-language literature and a reasonable balance between works by male and female authors with a prevalence of male authors.

I will direct my next readings towards African or Latin American literature.
